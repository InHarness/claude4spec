description: Implement features described in claude4spec briefs. Briefs are self-contained markdown files (entity snapshots, section diffs, narrative) that live in the companion specification repository, reached from your code repo via the c4s CLI (c4s list-briefs / read-brief, with --project and --workspace baked in). After implementation, if you discover drift between the brief and reality (missing details, incorrect assumptions, edge cases not covered), file a patch via c4s file-patch as feedback for the specification author. Use when implementing a claude4spec brief in a code repository.

This skill describes how to implement a release brief in **your code repository** (not the spec repo). A brief is a self-contained markdown file that captures everything you need to ship the change: entity snapshots, section diffs, narrative, acceptance criteria. Briefs live in the **spec** repository, a different repo from the one you are working in — you never touch it directly; the \`c4s\` CLI reaches everything for you.

**Reaching the briefs.** This skill is **CLI-only**: it reaches the briefs and writes patches solely through the \`c4s\` CLI, with the spec project's identity baked into this skill (\`${identity}\`) — \`c4s list-briefs\` / \`c4s read-brief\` / \`c4s file-patch\` work from any directory, without a running server (they are filesystem-scoped). If \`c4s\` is not installed, **stop** and ask the user to install it — do not read or write the spec repo's files by hand.

**The brief is self-contained.** You do not need to read the main specification or query the entity database — everything is in the brief body. If the brief references something you cannot find in its body, treat that as drift and file a patch (step 4 below).

## Workflow

### 1. Discover

List the briefs through \`c4s\` (paginated — briefs accumulate over time, so filter and page rather than dumping everything):

\`\`\`sh
c4s list-briefs --status pending --limit 10 ${identity}
\`\`\`

\`--status pending\` hides briefs already marked \`implemented: true\`; drop it to see all. Use \`--offset\` to page. Output lists each brief's \`path\` (which you pass to \`read-brief\`) and whether it is already implemented.

**Which brief do I implement?** If the user named a brief, use it. If not — and \`list-briefs\` returns more than one pending brief — **ask the user which one**; do NOT guess. Picking the wrong brief wastes an implementation pass. Only proceed automatically when there is exactly one obvious candidate (a single pending brief, or the user pointed at one).

### 2. Read the brief as self-contained input

Read the full brief by the \`path\` printed by \`list-briefs\`:

\`\`\`sh
c4s read-brief <brief-path> ${identity}
\`\`\`

The body contains everything you need — entity snapshots, section diffs, the narrative of what changes, and acceptance criteria. Read it and implement it; you do not need to understand how the brief was produced. **Do not read the main specification.**

If the brief is unclear — a missing detail, an ambiguous wording, a decision you'd otherwise have to guess — you have two paths.

**Synchronous (preferred when available).** Ask the specification agent in the same terminal and continue once you have an answer. Two distinct commands, by what context you need.

Preferred — context of THIS brief plus its release diff (the agent sees only the change window of the brief you are implementing):

\`\`\`bash
c4s agent "Brief nie precyzuje X — czy chodzi o A czy B?" --ct brief --brief <brief-path> ${identity}
\`\`\`

Alternative — read-only peer-consult of the CURRENT spec state (may be ahead of the brief you are implementing); no brief context, no \`--ct\`/\`--brief\`:

\`\`\`bash
c4s ask "Jak dziala Y w aktualnej specce?" ${identity}
\`\`\`

Continue the brief thread with \`c4s agent "..." --thread <threadId> ${identity}\` (the \`threadId\` is printed with the answer). This path requires \`c4s\` installed *and* a running \`npx @inharness-ai/claude4spec\` server. When either is unavailable, skip it.

**Asynchronous (always available).** If you cannot ask synchronously, proceed with your best judgement and file a patch afterwards (step 4) so the spec-author can fold the clarification into the next brief.

### 3. Implement

Standard code flow in your target repository: read existing code, plan, edit, test. Stay focused on what the brief specifies.

### 4. Feedback loop (patches)

When you discover that the brief diverges from reality — a missing detail, an incorrect assumption, an edge case not covered, or anything else the spec-author should know — file a patch. Use \`c4s file-patch\`, which records the patch on the spec side for you:

\`\`\`sh
printf '%s\\n' "$PATCH_BODY" | c4s file-patch \\
  --brief <brief-path> --desc "<short-desc>" --kind drift \\
  ${identity}
\`\`\`

The body (from stdin, or \`--body-file <f>\`) goes below an auto-generated \`# Patch — <short-desc>\` heading. Structure the body as two sections: a \`## What I found\` section (the drift / missing detail / incorrect assumption) and a \`## Suggestion\` section (what the spec-author should consider in a follow-up brief or entity edits). \`c4s file-patch\` records all the metadata for you (which brief it relates to, the kind from \`--kind\`, defaulting to \`drift\`) — you only write the markdown body.

\`--kind\` values:

- \`drift\` — the brief described behavior X, but the codebase already does Y.
- \`missing\` — the brief is silent on a detail you had to decide yourself.
- \`incorrect\` — the brief is factually wrong about existing code.
- \`clarification\` — the brief is ambiguous; you guessed but it should be made explicit for next time.

### 5. Mark brief as implemented

When the implementation is genuinely finished — code committed, tests green, merged to main / accepted by the user — mark the brief as implemented (\`implemented: true\`):

\`\`\`sh
c4s mark-brief-implemented <brief-path> ${identity}
\`\`\`

Unlike the filesystem-scoped \`c4s list-briefs\` / \`read-brief\` / \`file-patch\`, this command **requires a running \`npx @inharness-ai/claude4spec\` server** — if it isn't up, ask the user to start it. There is no by-hand file edit: this skill is CLI-only.

\`implemented: true\` is a **declaration**, not a computed fact derived from git. A revert on main does NOT roll the flag back. Set it ONLY when implementation is realistically done — never proactively or "just in case".

### 6. Hand-off

The spec-author picks up your patches on the spec side and folds each deviation back into the specification. That lifecycle lives entirely in the spec repo; you only write the raw markdown patch body via \`c4s file-patch\`.

## Notes

This is a **base skill** generated by claude4spec **on demand** — you got it either by downloading the ZIP from the Settings page or by running \`c4s install-skills\`, which writes it into your code repo's \`.claude/skills/\`. It already covers what you need to read briefs and ask the c4s agent questions. Feel free to **adapt it to your own workflow** (e.g. add a git/PR flow) or use it as-is. To refresh it against the current spec, re-download the ZIP or re-run \`c4s install-skills\` (overwrites the managed copy).
