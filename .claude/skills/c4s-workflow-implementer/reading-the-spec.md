# Reading the specification — the unit's recipe, `assembleSlice` and the split

The implementer and the verifier read the specification the same way, so two fresh contexts build the same packet. **Every read goes through `c4s release-diff`**, pinned to the window in `## This build`, never to the specification's live state: the specification may have moved on since the brief was written, and only `release-diff` reads it as it stood at a release. A command that reports the server is not running ends the run with status `error`; never read specification files by hand.

Two reads, one command:

- **The change** — `--from <from> --to <to>`: what the window did. For an entity, `before` and `after`; for a page, **only the changed sections**, each with `<before_change>` / `<after_change>` markers. A deletion comes back with `op: delete` and its `before`: that is what the code must remove.
- **The state at `<to>`** — `--from initial --to <to>`: everything as it stood at the release; every entry comes back as `create`, and its `after` (an entity) or its content (a section) is the state at `<to>`. This is the context the change needs.

## The recipe is the address book

The unit's `recipe` (from your scope, parsed from the brief's `Read:` lines) names **what** to read; this section is the only place that says **how**. `<identity>` is the identity flags from `## This build`.

| Recipe entry | Command |
| --- | --- |
| page `change: all` | `c4s release-diff --from <from> --to <to> --include pages --paths '<key>' <identity>` |
| page `change: {offset, limit}` | the same, plus `--section-offset <offset> --section-limit <limit>` |
| page `context: {offset, limit}` | `c4s release-diff --from initial --to <to> --include pages --paths '<key>' --section-offset <offset> --section-limit <limit> <identity>` |
| entities `{type, slugs}` | `c4s release-diff --from <from> --to <to> --include entities --entity-types <type> --slugs <s1,s2,…> --limit <number of slugs> <identity>` |
| convention `{key, offset}` | the `context` form with `--section-limit 1` |

In an initial window `<from>` is `initial`, so the change and the state at `<to>` are the same read.

- Sections are addressed **by position, not by anchor**: `offset` is the 0-based position in that read's `sections[]`, and the brief's range `6–9` is `offset 6, limit 4`. In a change read, `sections[]` holds only the changed sections, so `change` and `context` count differently; each carries its own numbers. Check the returned anchors against `anchors`: a mismatch is a wrong address, not a spec change — see "Read problems" below.
- One command per entity type (`--slugs` takes exactly one `--entity-types`). `--limit` is always the number of slugs: the default window is smaller than most slug lists. If an answer still has fewer entries than slugs, a slug is wrong or of another type — say so, do not conclude it is gone.
- Page keys are full keys, `<rootId>/<path>`, quoted. Always pass `--include`: without it the answer carries both dimensions.
- An answer cut short by the response budget carries `truncationHint` in flag form: run it as the next call.

### `deferred` and `completes` — a read built in steps

A read may carry `deferred: [{what, to, why}]`: a part of that page or entity this unit **must not build yet**, because it needs unit `to`. Read the whole read anyway — the part is context — but leave it unbuilt: no code for it, no behaviour stub pretending it exists, at most the seam the later unit needs (an empty slot, a route without the element). The verifier does not count a `deferred` part as missing; it does count it as a defect if it was built against a dependency that does not exist yet.

`completes: [{what, from}]` is the other end: the part that unit `from` left, now in scope here and verified here, together with the rest of the read.

A linked entity the recipe does not name — one a `links` field of its type (`## This build` → entity types) points at — is read at `<to>` the same way: `--from initial --to <to> --include entities --entity-types <t> --slugs <slug> --limit 1`.

## assembleSlice(unit or portion) → packet

A fixed sequence; the result goes to `.c4s-impl/packets/<unit>.md` (or `<unit>-<portion>.md`), gitignored. The packet is the implementer's only specification input for the run.

1. Run every read of the recipe, as the table above builds it, in order.
2. For each changed section, the state read at `<to>` gives the surrounding layer section and the module's purpose — the context the change sits in.
3. The entities the change links to, at `<to>`.
4. The criteria — the entities whose type has the role `criteria` (`## This build` → entity types): the type's `checks` field names the entities a criterion checks; every criterion in the recipe is in scope. Drop retired ones (the type's `inactive` field). Where no type has the role `criteria`, the unit's criteria are what its page reads state as expected, observable behaviour, each named by its section anchor.
   An entity of a `per-entity` type carries no role of its own: its parts in `## This build` → entity parts say which of its items are criteria, which are built and which are context. A multi-item part is in scope item by item, each named `<slug>#<key value>`; a `criteria` item has no `checks` field, it checks what its own entity and the section that embeds it describe.
5. The conventions from `## This build` whose layer the unit touches.
6. Stubs the unit must close (`stubs.json`, provider = unit) and stubs it may open.
7. The unit's `jobs`: each job's row of the user-jobs table (its address is in `conventions[]`), read as a convention — who does what, its success sentence, the modules it walks across.

Head the packet with: window, unit, goal, layers touched, entity counts, criteria count (`per-entity` criteria items included), jobs, packet size in bytes. Under every `per-entity` entity, list its parts and their items as `## This build` gives them, before the entity's content. List every `deferred` part under **Not yet** (what, which unit, why) and every `completes` part under **Completes**. Every deletion (`op: delete`, or a section whose change read is a lone `<before_change>`) is listed under **Remove**, next to its `before`.

### Read problems

The recipe's reads are checked here, by the unit that needs them — there is no global check before the build. While assembling, any of these is a **blocking deviation** of this unit:

- an entity read returns fewer entries than the slugs it names → `incorrect` (a wrong slug or type);
- a page range reads back sections whose anchors are not the ones the recipe labels it with → `clarification` (a wrong address);
- an active criterion whose `checks` field is empty → `clarification` (nothing to verify it against).

In split mode such a deviation is returned with `portions: []` and nothing else: the orchestrator blocks the unit and goes on with the others. In build mode it is reported as any blocking deviation.

## Split mode — `splitSlice(packet, budget)` → `split.json`

The implementer runs in split mode once per unit, before its first portion. It assembles the packet; if the packet fits `budget.packetKB`, it returns a single portion. Otherwise it cuts into as few portions as the budget allows:

1. **By layer**, in the layer order of the specification: fill a portion with the layers the unit touches, one after another, while it stays within the budget; the layer that does not fit opens the next portion. A portion carries the goal, the dependencies, its layers' sections, the edge cases, and the criteria whose `checks` field targets entities of its layers.
2. **By criteria group** only for a single layer over budget on its own: group criteria by the target of their `checks` field, sort groups by target slug, fill portions in that order. Never cut inside a prose section.

Every portion costs an implementer run with a fresh context that reads its packet from zero, so more portions are not safer, only slower: cut because a packet does not fit, never to make portions small.

Portions are named after their first and last layer: `<unit>/p1-l1-l7`, `<unit>/p2-l10-l13`, and `<unit>/p3-l2-b` for a criteria group; each lists its `slugs` and `layers`. A criterion that points at entities of two layers goes to the **later** layer's portion: behaviour is tested where all its parts exist. The items of a `per-entity` entity, of every role, travel in the portion of the layer whose section embeds that entity, and stay together. The unit's jobs travel in its last portion: a job's test needs everything the unit builds. A single section larger than the budget still travels whole; record a non-blocking `clarification` deviation ("section <anchor> exceeds the packet budget").

Split mode **returns** `split.json` and writes nothing else: the orchestrator records the portions in `state.json`, and they are never recomputed.

## Never in a packet

- content of other units (their slugs appear as stubs or dependencies, nothing more);
- a previous run's notes (there are none);
- the brief itself.
